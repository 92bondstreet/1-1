# Just listening

```
Just start by listening employee.

Shift review to the employee and give a place to the team member to speak.
I think we have to discuss with them to anwser following questions: What we can do as a company to help them be more productive, what they would like us to do as a company, and how we could improve them.

Note: Reviews were very time consuming and we did not want to create something that burdened Manager and wasted their time.
```

### 1. Which (and how) works have you done?
### 2. Which works have you moved later?
### 3. What can I do as your leader to build more skills?
### 4. How do you feel?
### 5. What will your goals be for the next 6 months, and what are the measurable outcomes of these goals?

# 360° peer review

```
Peer reviews provide greater insight from daily teammate interactions that each manager does not always have and are more likely to recognize each other's small successes.
My individual review is not enough to be objective and complete.
Each employee chooses 2 teammates for the peer review and answer only 2 questions about praising and redirect.
```

### 1. Which achievement or behaviour do you want to praise?
### 2. Which achievement or behaviour do you want to redirect?

# My review

```
My review is to inspire them to give their best inside the team and company.
Of course, I think we have not penalized for not hitting goals but encourage them.
```

### 1. List of achievement or behaviour to praise.
### 2. List of achievement or behaviour to redirect

# New habits

```
I think habits is better than goals. Goals focus on achievement and once done, we switch to another goals.
Habits help us be on autopilot and be better for the team.
A lot of online documentation spoke about at least 60 days to set a habit. That why, I think we have not to define more than 3 new habits.
```

### 1. Habits n°1
### 2. Habits n°2
### 3. Habits n°3
